This Pacman remake was made in python3 with pygame as homework for the subject of Programming II.

## The game

It is like the original arcade, the player controls the pacman, a sweet tooth character that must eat all the fruits without be touched by the ghosts who escaped from the prison. To learn how to play, run the game and press 'H' key to show game instructions.

## About the project

This game was developed with python3 and the pygame 2.0 (the python library to make 2d games) as an technical schoolwork. It was simple to make the game, it has few and simple features, but it was still fun. 
The main difficulty in developing the game was the maze, I started making it with a matrix, but this proved to be unfeasible and not scalable, so I decided to use images (a logical image and a graphic one).

### Project finished and closed

The game has simple features and has nothing I would like to add (maybe just add some new levels, perhaps) is just a simple homework, so it is finished! If you want to contribute or use the code as an example, just clone it and do whatever you want.
